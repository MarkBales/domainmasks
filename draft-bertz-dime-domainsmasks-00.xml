<t>
    An optional Diameter Attribute Value Pair (AVP) is defined
    in this document for DNS support.  It is the DNS-Filters AVP
    which contains a list of DNS query names that follow the
    registered name QNAME format defined in <xref target="RFC1034"/>, Section 3.7.1
    and subsequent updates, notably <xref target="RFC4592"/>.
</t>
<t>
    DNS Filter AVPs are used in various operator policy enforcement
    applications such as child protections, parental controls and
    flow based rating.
</t>
<t>
    Current practices require any updates to these applications to
    be sideloaded, i.e. updated via a file, on the enforcement points
    or proprietary mechanism.  As an AVP, the list of entries in the
    AVP may be dynamically updated per current Diameter application
    specifications, e.g. <xref target="RFC7155"/>.
</t>
<t>
    The second AVP, ArbitraryMask-AVP, defines an arbitrary
    bitmask for various maskable AVPs used in Classifiers <xref target="RFC5777"/>.
</t>
<t>
    Prefix based masks are present in <xref target="RFC5777"/> but the
    technologies such as Software Defined Networking (SDN) introduce
    new arbitrary bitmasks on multiple data types in the various
    protocol headers.

   Setting the DNS-Filter value would specify the capture flows whose
   DNS related communications match the QUERY values specified in the
   Classifier.
</t>
<t>
   DNS related communications are those DNS queries which have valid
   DNS responses for scope implied by the container of the
   Classifier, i.e. if the Classifer is contained by a Filter-Rule
   installed during a mobility session then only resulting IP
   addresses conatined in DNS traffic for the mobility session is
   used in the selection of flows.
</t>
<t>
   The use of the DNS-Filters AVP implies that the following conditions
   exist:
   <list style="symbols">
         <t>The related DNS traffic is known by the enforcement point</t>
         <t>The related DNS traffic is viewable by the enforcement point</t>
   </list>
</t>
<t>
   Such conditions are met in network services related to child
   protections and parental controls.
</t>
<t>
   Use of secured DNS communications <xref target="RFC4033"/> is recommended.
   In such a case the enforemcent point may be a DNS relay used, as
   part of the network access service, to enforce or report generate
   Diameter events in applications such as Application Detection and
   Charging <xref target="TGPPCC"/> using DNS-Filters.

   Setting the IP-Address-Mask-Pattern value would permit the
   capture of an arbitrarily masked IP pattern the flow. NOTE that
   if the value of this AVP is only '1' starting from the least
   significant bit it is no different than the IP-Address-Mask which
   could be used instead.
</t>
<t>
   Setting the Flow-Label value would permit capture of IPv6 packets
   with a specific Flow Label.  Setting the Flow-Label-Mask-Pattern
   permits the capture of flows that match the appropriate mask
   pattern applied to the Flow Label.

<t>
    The use of DNS-Filters AVP implies visible access to DNS traffic
    associated with the containing rule's, e.g. Filter-Rule <xref target="RFC5777"/>.  It
    does not imply a specific design for DNS communications but it is
    strongly recommended that secured DNS communciations <xref target="RFC4033"/> are used.
</t>
<t>
    In other words, it is NOT recommended to turn off secured DNS
    communications if this value is present.   Rather, a Diameter
    application appropriate error should be thrown to indicate the
    rule cannot be enforced.
</t>
<t>
    An operator that can accomplish the same use cases, e.g. child
    protection or parental control, without the need to see customer
    DNS traffic is encouraged to do so.
</t>
</section>
<section title="SDN AVP Usage" anchor="sdnavpsec">
<t>
   This document describes SDN related attributes an extension of <xref target="RFC5777"/>.
</t>
<t>
   It introduces a new to/from arbitraty mask for IP addresses.
   As this is an extension to <xref target="RFC5777"/>, which
   already has an IP-Address-Mask defined it does not raise new
   security concerns.
</t>
<t>
   This document does introduce the ability to filter upon the IPv6
   Flow Labels <xref target="RFC2460"/>. Even though this is a
   visible IP header it was not previously defined in Diameter
   related filters but has been used for activities such as Traffic
   Selection <xref target="RFC6088"/>.
</t>
<t>
   Per <xref target="RFC2460"/> the flow label is used by a source
   to request special handling by routers.  If a specific type of
   host has known flow label usage, i.e. signature, inspection of
   this field over one or more flows may yield information.  However,
   the flow label is visible in the IPv6 header and thus this
   information is discernable by any device with access to the IPv6
   packet.  Recommendations on the security considerations of IPv6
   flow usage is outside of the scope of this document.
